We place a strong emphasis on engaging students from our world-class universities and onboard them to the ecosystem. At its core, it is an annual hackathon and conference, but it has further ambitions as a support infrastructure for up-and-coming builders, researchers, and public-goods projects in Montreal. ",

This is achieved by keeping hackathon attendants engaged post the main annual event. | Stimulating academic research into open problems various areas: scalability, coordination, new artistic expressions, and public goods. | . | .
